# MisModPublisher 

â€‹An Alternative Tool To Upload Your Miscreated Mods On Steam
</td></tr></table>



MisModPublisher is a tool designed to simplify the process of uploading and updating your mods on Steam.
Easier and more convenient to use than the regular SteamCMD, this application lets you :

- Create a reference file (vdf) for your mod, including : Title, Description, Changenotes, Steam Tags ...
- Upload/update your mod on Steam without disconnecting your Steam account.
- Automatically open your mod page at the end of the upload to let you personnalize it.

We are going to detail the process of each steps in the subsections below.

**************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
</div>

1. Copy your Mod freshly created into the MiscreatedMods/Mods folder.

2. Open your mod.vdf file

>If you don't have any reference file (.vdf) you can simply create one using tools/createVDF.bat (instructions below) and jump to #6.

3. Edit the paths of "contentfolder" and "previewfile" to match the new locations. 

> For example, if you have extracted misModPublisher in your desktop, that would be:
>`C:\\Users\\[YOURNAME]\\Desktop\\MiscreatedMods\\Mods\\[YOURMOD]\\Paks` 
>
>and
>
> `C:\\Users\\[YOURNAME]\\Desktop\\MiscreatedMods\\Mods\\[YOURMOD]\\Images\\[YOURIMAGE]`

4. Be sure to fill every following queries : Title / Description / Changenote

5. You can also add Steam Tags to better detail your mod. For example : 

> `"tags"   "admin,item,weapons"`
>
> Only use lowercase characters when setting your tags. THIS IS IMPORTANT.

6. Go back to misModPublisher main folder and copy/past the UploadToWorkshop.bat file into your Mod folder >> where your mod.vdf is.

7. Double click on your UploadToWorkshop.bat to start the upload. misModPublisher will automatically open your brand new mod page.

>IMPORTANT : a new txt file has been created into your mod folder, containing your mod ID. 
>Copy that ID into your vdf file, in the "publishedfileid" query.
